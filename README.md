## General Info

The idea for Swap came to me when my friend and I decided to each clean out our closets and exchange things that we no longer use anymore. We each discovered things that we liked and found value in from the other person pile and we could do all of this without spending a dime. Swap makes this process much more functional and adds the convenience of being able to display all of your tradable items and see your friends tradable items all in one place.
